# Bayesian Data Analysis

I'm working through the third edition of ["Bayesian Data Analysis"](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/book/). This repository contains code that I write to solve the problems. Notes on the textbook and interesting practice problems [here](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kcxtwnhwcskd).
